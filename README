/**
 * TWITTER FACTORY
 *
 * Searches twitter for multiple search terms and stores them in a database.
 *
 * You'll want to attach this to a cron job.
 *
 * Here's the MySQL table structure it uses...
 *
 * CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tweets` (
 *   `id` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
 *   `published` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
 *   `content` varchar(500) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
 *   `handle` varchar(100) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
 *   `avatar` varchar(500) DEFAULT NULL,
 *   `parsed` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
 *   PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
 * ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
 *
 * Make sure to change the variables in the db() method to connect to your database!
